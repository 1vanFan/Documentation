# Agora Cloud Recording RESTful API Quickstart
Agora Cloud Recording provides a RESTful API for you to control cloud recording through HTTP requests.

> - You need to send the requests from your own app server.
> - The RESTful API only supports HTTPS.

![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1559549537706)

With the RESTful API, you can send requests to do the following things:

- Start/Stop cloud recording

- Query the recording status

The Agora Cloud Recording RESTful API provides a callback service. After enabling the callback service, you can receive notifications about cloud recording events. See the table below for the differences between the recording status query and the callback service.

| Recording status query                                       | Callback service                                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| Call the [`query`](https://docs-preview.agoralab.co/cn/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_api_rest?platform=All%20Platforms#query) method to get the status. | Configure an HTTP server and enable the callback service. |
| You need to request for the status update.                   | You are notified when an event occurs.                   |
| Provides only the M3U8 filename and the recording status.    | Provides notifications about all events with details.        |

If you need to use the callback sercive, see [RESTful API Callbacks](../../en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_callback_rest.md) for details.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you meet the following requirements:

- Contact [sales-us@agora.io](mailto:sales-us@agora.io) to enable the Agora Cloud Recording service.
- Deploy a third-party cloud storage. Agora Cloud Recording supports [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc1=h_ls), [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/oss), and [Qiniu Cloud](https://www.qiniu.com/en/products/kodo).

> Agora Cloud Recording does not support string user accounts. Ensure that the recording channel uses integer UIDs.
## Pass basic authentication

The RESTful API requires the basic HTTP authentication. You need to set the `Authorization` parameter in every HTTP request header. For how to get the value for `Authorization`, see [RESTful API authentication](https://docs.agora.io/en/faq/restful_authentication).

## Get a resource ID

Call the [`acquire`](../../en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_api_rest.md) method to request a resource ID for cloud recording. 

If this method call succeeds, you get a resource ID (`resourceId`) from the HTTP response body. The resource ID is valid for five minutes, so you need to start recording with this resource ID within five minutes.

> One resource ID can only be used for one recording session.

See the [`acquire` examples](../../en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_api_rest.md) for the request and response examples.

## Start recording

Call the [`start`](../../en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_api_rest.md) method within five minutes after getting the resource ID to start the recording. 

See the [`start` examples](../../en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_api_rest.md) for the request and response examples.

## Query recording status

During the recording, you can call the [`query`](../../en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_api_rest.md) method to check the recording status multiple times.

If this method call succeeds, you get the M3U8 filename and the current recording status from the HTTP response body.

See the [`query` examples](../../en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_api_rest.md) for the request and response examples.

## Stop recording

Call the [`stop`](../../en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_api_rest.md) method to stop the recording.

See the [`stop` examples](../../en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_api_rest.md) for the request and response examples.

## Upload and manage the recorded files

After the recording starts, the Agora server automatically splits the recorded content into multiple TS files and keeps uploading them to the third-party cloud storage until the recording stops.

### Recording ID

The recording ID is the unique identification of a recording. Each cloud recording session has a unique recording ID.

After starting the recording with the [`start`](../../en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_api_rest.md) request, you can get the recording ID from its response. You can also get the recording ID from any of the callbacks.

### <a name="m3u8"></a>Playlist of the recorded files

Each recording session has an M3U8 file, which is a playlist pointing to all the split TS files of the recording. You can use the M3U8 file to play and manage the recorded files.

The name of the M3U8 file consists of the recording ID and the channel name. For example`recording_id_channel_name.M3U8`.

### Upload the recorded files

The Agora server automatically uploads the recorded files. Pay attention to the following callbacks.

During the recording, the SDK triggers the following callback once every minute:

- [`uploading_progress`](../../en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_callback_rest.md): Reports the upload progress (%) of the recorded files.

After the recording stops, the SDK triggers one of the following callbacks:

- [`uploaded`](../../en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_callback_rest.md): Occurs when all the recorded files are uploaded to the third-party cloud storage.
- [`backuped`](../../en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_callback_rest.md): Occurs when some of the recorded files fail to upload to the third-party cloud storage and upload to Agora Cloud Backup instead. Agora Cloud Backup automatically uploads these files to your cloud storage. If you cannot [play the recorded files](https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_onlineplay) after five minutes, contact Agora technical support.
