# Adjust the Pitch and Tone
## Introduction 
In social and entertainment scenarios, users often need various voice effects to enhance the interactive experiences. Agora provides methods to flexibly change the users' voice, such as adjusting the pitch and setting the equalization and reverberation modes.

## Implementation
Ensure that you prepared the development environment. See [Integrate the SDK](../../en/Interactive%20Broadcast/android_video.md).

The following sample code shows how to change the original voice to Hulk's voice.

```java
// Sets the pitch. The value ranges between 0.5 and 2.0. The lower the value, the lower the pitch. The default value is 1.0, which is the original pitch.
double pitch = 0.5;
rtcEngine.setLocalVoicePitch(pitch);

// Sets the local voice equalization.
// The first parameter sets the band frequency. The value ranges between 0 and 9. Each value represents the center frequency of the band: 31, 62, 125, 250, 500, 1k, 2k, 4k, 8k, and 16k Hz
// The second parameter sets the gain of each band. The value ranges between -15 and 15 dB. The default value is 0.
rtcEngine.setLocalVoiceEqualization(0, -15);
rtcEngine.setLocalVoiceEqualization(1, 3);
rtcEngine.setLocalVoiceEqualization(2, -9);
rtcEngine.setLocalVoiceEqualization(3, -8);
rtcEngine.setLocalVoiceEqualization(4, -6);
rtcEngine.setLocalVoiceEqualization(5, -4);
rtcEngine.setLocalVoiceEqualization(6, -3);
rtcEngine.setLocalVoiceEqualization(7, -2);
rtcEngine.setLocalVoiceEqualization(8, -1);
rtcEngine.setLocalVoiceEqualization(9, 1);

// The level of the dry signal in dB. The value ranges between -20 and 10.
rtcEngine.setLocalVoiceReverb(AudioConst.REVERB_DRY_LEVEL, 10);

// The level of the early reflection signal (wet signal) in dB. The value ranges between -20 and 10.
rtcEngine.setLocalVoiceReverb(AudioConst.REVERB_WET_LEVEL, 7);

// The room size of the reverberation. A larger room size means a stronger reverberation. The value ranges between 0 and 100.
rtcEngine.setLocalVoiceReverb(AudioConst.REVERB_ROOM_SIZE, 6);

// The length of the initial delay of the wet signal (ms). The value ranges between 0 and 200.
rtcEngine.setLocalVoiceReverb(AudioConst.REVERB_WET_DELAY, 124);

// The reverberation strength. The value ranges between 0 and 100. The higher the value, the stronger the reverberation.
rtcEngine.setLocalVoiceReverb(AudioConst.REVERB_STRENGTH, 78);
```

### API Methods

- [setLocalVoicePitch](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/API%20Reference/java/classio_1_1agora_1_1rtc_1_1_rtc_engine.html#a41b525f9cbf2911594bcda9b20a728c9)
- [setLocalVoiceEqualization](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/API%20Reference/java/classio_1_1agora_1_1rtc_1_1_rtc_engine.html#a9e3aa79f0d6d8f2ea81907543506d960)

## Considerations
The API methods have return values. If the method fails, the return value is < 0.
