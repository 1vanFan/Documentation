# Error Codes and Warning Codes
The Agora Web SDK will return error or warning codes when calling APIs or during runtime:

-   **Error Codes** occur when the SDK encounters an error that cannot be recovered automatically without any application intervention. For example, the SDK returns an error if it fails to turn on the camera, and reminds the user not to use the camera.

-   **Warning Codes** occur when the SDK encounters an error that might be recovered automatically. These are only notifications, and can generally be ignored.
