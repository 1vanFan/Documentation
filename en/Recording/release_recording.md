# Release Notes for the Recording SDK
## Overview

The Agora Recording SDK records communication and live broadcast contents based on the Agora Native SDK or/and Agora Web SDK.

### Compatibility

This component package is compatible with the following SDKs:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col/>
<col/>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr><th>SDK</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Agora Native SDK</td>
<td>The Agora Recording SDK is compatible with the Agora Native SDK v1.7.0 or later. If any user in the channel uses the Agora SDK v1.6, the whole channel will not be able to record.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Agora Web SDK</td>
<td>The Recording SDK is compatible with the Agora Web SDK v1.12.0 or later.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



### Known Issues and Limitation

-   When you record using an Android client, the image is turned upside down when you switch from a front-facing camera to a rear one.
-   If the user calls <code>leaveChannel</code> in the channel to stop recording, the recording file ends with a period of silence determined by the <code>idleLimitSec</code> field set for the configuration when calling <code>joinChannel</code>.
-   The recorded voice or video files are not encrypted. To be compliant with HIPPA, encrypt the disk with a disk encryption tool, such as cryptsetup.
-   The recording SDK only stores the original video file passed from the clientâ€™s side. When creating the MPEG-4 media file, the SDK adjusts the rotation once based on the rotational information found in the `uid_xxx.txt` file. In other words, no matter how many times the video rotates, the Agora Recording SDK rotates it once only according to the first rotational information in the `uid_xxx.txt` file. You can change the converting script according to the rotational information in the `uid_xxx.txt` file to generate the rotated video. Agora plans to add a new feature enabling video rotation by a converting script in version 2.3.


> Agora Recording SDK supports both Java and C++ from v2.2.0.

## v2.2.3 

The version 2.2.3 was released on October 18, 2018. See below for issues fixed.

### Issues Fixed

-   Coredump loss caused by .backtrace.
-   Fixed system crash caused by Java jni. and optimized stability.
-   Bug of the transcoding script in manully mode. 
-   The recording video file was split into two files after a web client joined the channel.
-   Occasional system crash caused by the issue that the sub thread was still active after the main thread was released.

## v2.2.2 

The version 2.2.2 was released on August 1, 2018. See below for new features, improvements, and issues fixed.

### Improvements

-   The naming of the screenshots will be `uidYmdHMSms.jpg` instead of `uidYmdHMS.jpg`.
-   The transcoding script supports autorotation.
-   The structure of the Java folder is modified.

## v2.2.1

The version 2.2.1 was released on June  5, 2018. See below for new features, improvements, and issues fixed.

### Improvements

-   Improved the performance of the communication mode. The number of recording channels that a system supports with the same performance has increased by 150%.
-   Improved the efficiency to find the port.
-   The time to find the port is no longer part of the idle time.


### Issues Fixed

Port conflicts when the search for the port takes too long and exceeds the idle time. As a result, the port is not connected.


## v2.2.0

The version 2.2.0 was released on May 4, 2018. See below for issues fixed.
