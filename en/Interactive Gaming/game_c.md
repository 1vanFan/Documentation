Cocos Creator automatically downloads and configures all the resources necessary for Agora service. The Agora object provides you with [major APIs](../../en/Interactive%20Gaming/game_coco.md).

   > The JavaScript APIs provided by Cocos Creator only covers major functions. For more advanced functions, see the full API reference documents on other platforms.

3. In your project, call the APIs for voice call in gaming. For detailed information on the core API methods see the [`HelloAgora` Demo](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Voice-Call-for-Mobile-Gaming/tree/master/Basic-Voice-Call-for-Gaming/Hello-Cocos-Creator-Voice-Agora)。
