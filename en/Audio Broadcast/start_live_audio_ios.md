# Start an Audio Broadcast
Use this guide to quickly start an audio broadcast demo with the Agora Voice SDK for iOS.

The difference between a broadcast and a call is that users have roles in a broadcast. You can set your role as either Broadcaster or Audience. The broadcaster sends and receives streams while the audience receives streams only.

## Try the demo

We provide an open-source [OpenLive-Voice-Only-iOS-Objective-C](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Basic-Audio-Broadcasting/tree/master/OpenLive-Voice-Only-iOS-Objective-C)/[OpenLive-Voice-Only-iOS](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Basic-Audio-Broadcasting/tree/master/OpenLive-Voice-Only-iOS) demo project that implements the basic audio broadcast on GitHub. You can try the demo and view the source code.

## Prerequisites

- Xcode 9.0 or later
- An iOS device running iOS 8.0 or later
- A valid Agora account. ([Sign up](https://sso.agora.io/en/signup) for free)

<div class="alert note">Open the specified ports in <a href="https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/firewall?platform=All%20Platforms">Firewall Requirements</a > if your network has a firewall.</div>

## Set up the development environment

In this section, we will create an iOS project, and integrate the SDK into the project.

### Create an iOS project
Now, let's build an iOS project from scratch. Skip to [Integrate the SDK](#IntegrateSDK) if an iOS project already exists.

<details>
	<summary><font color="#3ab7f8">Create an iOS project</font></summary>

### <a name="IntegrateSDK"></a>Integrate the SDK
Choose either of the following methods to integrate the Agora SDK into your project.

**Method 1: Automatically integrate the SDK with CocoaPods**

<div class="alert note">This method is only for integrating the SDK with the static library.</div>

1. Ensure that you have installed **CocoaPods** before the following steps. See the installation guide in [Getting Started with CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).
2. In **Terminal**, go to the project path and run the `pod init` command to create a **Podfile** in the project folder.
3. Open the **Podfile**, delete all contents and input the following contents. Remember to change **Your App** to the target name of your project.
```
# platform :ios, '9.0' use_frameworks!
target 'Your App' do
    pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS'
end
```

<div class="alert note">Ensure that you use <tt>pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS_Crypto'</tt> to replace <tt>pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS'</tt> when using the channel encryption function. After integrating the encryption library, the app size increases.</div>

4. Go back to **Terminal**, and run the `pod update` command to update the local libraries.
5. Run the `pod install` command to install the Agora SDK. Once you successfully install the SDK, it shows `Pod installation complete!` in Terminal, and you can see an **xcworkspace** file in the project folder.
6. Open the generated xcworkspace file in **Xcode**.

**Method 2: Manually add the SDK files**

1. Go to [SDK Downloads](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/downloads), download the latest version of the Agora SDK for iOS, and unzip the downloaded SDK package.

  <div class="alert note">As of v3.0.0, the downloaded SDK package includes both the static library and the dynamic library. The name suffix of the SDK with dynamic library is Dynamic. </div>

2. Copy the **AgoraRtcKit.framework** file in the **libs** folder to the project folder.
3. When integrate the static library, open **Xcode** (take the Xcode 11.0 as an example), go to the **TARGETS > Project Name > Build Phases > Link Binary with Libraries** menu, and click **+** to add the following frameworks and libraries. For adding **AgoraRtcKit.framework**, you also need to click **Add Other...** after clicking **+**.

	- AgoraRtcKit.framework
	- Accelerate.framework
	- AudioToolbox.framework
	- AVFoundation.framework
	- CoreMedia.framework
	- CoreTelephony.framework
	- libc++.tbd
	- libresolv.tbd
	- SystemConfiguration.framework


4. When integrate the dynamic library, open **Xcode** (take the Xcode 11.0 as an example), go to the **TARGETS > Project Name > General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content** menu, click **Add Other...** after clicking **+** to add **AgoraRtcKit.framework**. Once added, the project automatically links to other system libraries.
  <div class="alert warning">According to the requirement of Apple, the Extension of app cannot contain the dynamic library. If you need to integrate the SDK with the dynamic library in the Extension, change the file status as <b>Do Not Embed</b>.</div>

<div class="alert note"><li>As of v3.0.0, the library name changes from <b>AgoraRtcEngineKit.framework</b> to <b>AgoraRtcKit.framework</b>. To upgrade your SDK to v3.0.0, refer to the following steps to re-integrate the SDK:<ul><ul><li>Open Xcode, remove <b>AgoraRtcEngineKit.framework</b> from the Navigator.<li>Click <b>TARGETS > Project Name > Build Phases > Link Binary with Libraries</b>, click <b>-</b> to remove AgoraRtcEngineKit.framework.<li> If you integrate the SDK with the static library, click <b>TARGETS > Project Name > Build Phases > Link Binary with Libraries</b>, and click <b>+</b> to add AgoraRtcKit.framework instead.<br>If you integrate the SDK with the dynamic library, click <b>TARGETS > Project Name > General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content</b>, click <b>+</b> to add AgoraRtcKit.framework instead, and change the status of <b>AgoraRtcKit.framework</b> to <b>Embed & Sign</b>. </br></ul><li>Ensure that you integrate <b>AgoraRtcCryptoLoader.framework</b> when using the channel encryption function. After integrating the library, the app size increases.</div>

## Implement the basic broadcast

This section introduces how to use the Agora SDK to make an interactive broadcast. The following figure shows the API call sequence of a basic audio broadcast.
![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1585490874581)

### 1. Create the UI

Create the user interface (UI) for the audio broadcast in your project. Skip to [Import the class](#ImportClass) if you already have a UI in your project.

When you are implementing an audio broadcast, we recommend adding the following elements into the UI:

- The audio broadcast window
- The exit button
	
When you use the UI setting of the demo project, you can see the following interface:

![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1585490926278)

### <a name="ImportClass"></a>2. Import the class

Import the `AgoraRtcKit` class in your project.

```objective-c
// Objective-C
// As of v3.0.0, the SDK uses the AgoraRtcKit object.
#import <AgoraRtcKit/AgoraRtcEngineKit.h>
// The SDK of a version earlier than v3.0.0 uses the AgoraRtcEngineKit object.
#import <AgoraRtcEngineKit/AgoraRtcEngineKit.h>
```

```swift
// Swift
// As of v3.0.0, the SDK uses the AgoraRtcKit object.
import AgoraRtcKit
// The SDK of a version earlier than v3.0.0 uses the AgoraRtcEngineKit object.
import AgoraRtcEngineKit
```

<div class="alert note"> The Agora Native SDK uses libc++ (LLVM) by default. Contact Agora support If you want to use libstdc++ (GNU). The SDK provides FAT image libraries with multi-architecture support for both 32/64-bit audio emulators and 32/64-bit audio real devices.</div>

### 3. Initialize AgoraRtcEngineKit

Create and initialize the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` object before calling any other Agora APIs.

In this step, you need to use the App ID of your project. Follow these steps to [create an Agora project](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/manage_projects?platform=All%20Platforms) in Console and get an [App ID](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/terms?platform=All%20Platforms#a-nameappidaapp-id ).

1. Go to [Console](https://dashboard.agora.io/) and click the **[Project Management](https://dashboard.agora.io/projects)** icon ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1551254998344) on the left navigation panel. 
2. Click **Create** and follow the on-screen instructions to set the project name, choose an authentication mechanism, and Click **Submit**. 
3. On the **Project Management** page, find the **App ID** of your project. 

Call the `sharedEngineWithAppId` method and pass in the App ID to initialize the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` object.

You can also listen for callback events, such as when the broadcaster joins the channel and leaves the channel. 

```objective-c
// Objective-C
- (void)initializeAgoraEngine {
    // Input your App ID to initialize the AgoraRtcEngineKit object.
    self.agoraKit = [AgoraRtcEngineKit sharedEngineWithAppId:appID delegate:self];
}
```

```swift
// Swift
func initializeAgoraEngine() {
   // Initialize the AgoraRtcEngineKit object.
   agoraKit = AgoraRtcEngineKit.sharedEngine(withAppId: AppID, delegate: self)
}
```

### 4. Set the channel profile

After initializing the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` object, call the `setChannelProfile` method to set the channel profile as Live Broadcast. 

One `AgoraRtcEngineKit` object uses one profile only. If you want to switch to another profile, destroy the current `AgoraRtcEngineKit` object with the `destroy` method and create a new one before calling the `setChannelProfile` method.

```objective-c
// Objective-C
// Set the channel profile.
[self.agoraKit setChannelProfile:AgoraChannelProfileLiveBroadcasting];
```

```swift
// Swift
// Set the channel profile.
agoraKit.setChannelProfile(.liveBroadcasting)
```

### 5. Set the client role

A Live Broadcast channel has two client roles: `Broadcaster` and `Audience`, and the default role is `Audience`. After setting the channel profile to `Live Broadcast`, your app may use the following steps to set the client role:

1. Allow the user to set the role as `Broadcaster` or `Audience`. 
2. Call the `setClientRole` method and pass in the client role set by the user.

Note that in a live broadcast, only the broadcaster can be heard. If you want to switch the client role after joining the channel, call the `setClientRole` method.

```objective-c
// Objective-C
 if (self.isBroadcaster) {
        self.clientRole = AgoraClientRoleAudience;
        if (self.fullSession.uid == 0) {
            self.fullSession = nil;
        }
    } else {
        self.clientRole = AgoraClientRoleBroadcaster;
    }
    // Set the client role.
    [self.rtcEngine setClientRole:self.clientRole];
```

```swift
// Swift
// Set the client role.
agoraKit.setClientRole(.audience)
agoraKit.setClientRole(.broadcaster)
```

### <a name="JoinChannel"></a>6. Join a channel

After setting the client role, you can call the `joinChannelByToken` method to join a channel. In this method, set the following parameters:

- channelId: Specify the channel name that you want to join. Input your `channelId` before running the sample code.
- token: Pass a token that identifies the role and privilege of the user.  You can set it as one of the following values:
	- `nil`.
	- A temporary token generated in Console. A temporary token is valid for 24 hours. For details, see [Get a Temporary Token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-a-temporary-token).
	- A token generated at the server. This applies to scenarios with high-security requirements. For details, see [Generate a token from Your Server](../../en/Audio%20Broadcast/token_server.md).
	<div class="alert note">If your project has enabled the app certificate, ensure that you provide a token.</div>
- uid: ID of the local user that is an integer and should be unique. If you set `uid` as 0,  the SDK assigns a user ID for the local user and returns it in the `joinSuccessBlock` callback.
- joinSuccessBlock: Returns that the user joins the specified channel. It is same as `didJoinChannel`. We recommend setting `joinSuccessBlock` as `nil`, so that the SDK can trigger the `didJoinChannel` callback.

For more details on the parameter settings, see [joinChannelByToken](https://docs.agora.io/en/Audio%20Broadcast/API%20Reference/oc/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/joinChannelByToken:channelId:info:uid:joinSuccess:).

<div class="alert note">For Native SDKs prior to v3.0.0, you need to call <code>enableWebSdkInteroperability</code> to enable the interoperability with the Web SDK if there is a Web users in the channel. As of v3.0.0, the Native SDK enables its interoperability with the Web SDK by default.</div>

```objective-c
// Objective-C
- (void)joinChannel {
    // Join a channel with a token.
    [self.agoraKit joinChannelByToken:token channelId:@"demoChannel1" info:nil uid:0 joinSuccess:^(NSString *channel, NSUInteger uid, NSInteger elapsed) {
    }];
}
```

```swift
// Swift
// Join a channel with a token.
agoraKit.joinChannel(byToken: KeyCenter.Token, channelId: channelId, info: nil, uid: 0, joinSuccess: nil)
```

### 7. Leave the channel

Call the `leaveChannel` method to leave the current call according to your scenario, for example, when the call ends, when you need to close the app, or when your app runs in the background.

```objective-c
// Objective-C
    // Leave the channel.
    [self.rtcEngine leaveChannel:nil];
    if (self.isBroadcaster) {
        [self.rtcEngine stopPreview];
    }
```

```swift
// Swift
func leaveChannel() {       
    setIdleTimerActive(true)
    // Leave the channel.
    agoraKit.leaveChannel(nil)
    if settings.role == .broadcaster {
       agoraKit.stopPreview()
    }
    navigationController?.popViewController(animated: true)
    }
```

### Sample code

You can find the sample code logic in the [OpenLive-Voice-Only-iOS-Objective-C](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Basic-Audio-Broadcasting/tree/master/OpenLive-Voice-Only-iOS-Objective-C)/[OpenLive-Voice-Only-iOS](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Basic-Audio-Broadcasting/tree/master/OpenLive-Voice-Only-iOS) demo project.

## Run the project

Run the project on your iOS device. When you set the role as the broadcaster and successfully join an audio broadcast, you can hear the voice of the broadcaster in the app.
