# Push Streams to the CDN
## Introduction

The process of publishing streams into the CDN (Content Delivery Network) is called CDN live streaming, where users can view the live broadcast through a web browser.

When multiple hosts are in the channel in the CDN live streaming, [transcoding](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/terms?platform=All%20Platforms#transcoding) is used to combine the streams of all the hosts into a single stream. Transcoding sets the audio/video profiles and the picture-in-picture layout for the stream to be pushed to the CDN.

The following figure shows a typical CDN-pushing scenario.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you contact sales@agora.io to enable Agora's transcoding service before using this function.

## Implementation

Agora's CDN publishing solution is based on the following API methods to publish streams to the CDN, inject external audio streams, transcode, and set the output layout.

-   [`setLiveTranscoding`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Audio%20Broadcast/API%20Reference/oc/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/setLiveTranscoding:): Sets the live transcoding configuration.
-   [`addPublishStreamUrl`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Audio%20Broadcast/API%20Reference/oc/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/addPublishStreamUrl:transcodingEnabled:): Adds a stream to the CDN.
-   [`removePublishStreamUrl`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Audio%20Broadcast/API%20Reference/oc/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/removePublishStreamUrl:): Removes a stream from the CDN.

In which:

-  The host calls the `setLiveTranscoding` method to set the transcoding parameters, for example, the canvas settings, after joining a channel. The host still needs to set a 16 &times; 16 view when only publishing an audio stream to CDN.
-  The host adds or removes a URL with the `addPublishStreamUrl` and `removePublishStreamUrl` methods after joining the channel.

### Sample Code

```objective-c
// CDN transcoding settings.
AgoraLiveTranscodingUser *user = [[AgoraLiveTranscodingUser alloc] init];
user.uid = 12345;
user.rect = CGRectMake(0, 0, 16, 16);
user.audioChannel = 0;

AgoraRtcEngineKit *rtcEngine = [AgoraRtcEngineKit sharedEngineWithAppId:@"" delegate:nil];
AgoraLiveTranscoding *transcoding = [[AgoraLiveTranscoding alloc] init];
transcoding.audioSampleRate = AgoraAudioSampleRateType44100;
transcoding.audioChannels = 2;
transcoding.size = CGSizeMake(16, 16);
transcoding.videoFramerate = 15;
transcoding.videoCodecProfile = AgoraVideoCodecProfileTypeHigh;
transcoding.transcodingUsers = @[user];

[rtcEngine setLiveTranscoding:transcoding];
```

```objective-c
// Adds a URL to which the host pushes a stream.
// Set the transcodingEnabled parameter as YES to enable the transcoding service. Once transcoding is enabled, you nee to set the live transcoding configurations by calling the setLiveTranscoding method. We do not recommend transcoding in the case of a single host.
[rtcEngine addPublishStreamUrl:streamUrl transcodingEnabled:YES];
```

```objective-c
// Removes a URL to which the host pushes a stream.
[rtcEngine removePublishStreamUrl:streamUrl];
```

## Considerations

Ensure that you contact sales@agora.io to enable Agora's transcoding service before using this function.
