# Billing for Audio broadcasting
## Overview


At the beginning of each calendar month, Agora charges you for services used. This article describes how Agora calculates the billing for the services used of the Audio Broadcasting SDK. You can see additional billing information pertaining to other Agora products and add-ons below:



- [Billing for On-premise Recording](https://docs.agora.io/en/Recording/billing_recording?platform=All%20Platforms)
- [Billing for Cloud Recording](https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/billing_cloud_recording?platform=All%20Platforms)



For more information about billing, fee deduction, and account suspension, see [Billing, Fee Deduction, and Account Suspension](https://docs.agora.io/en/faq/billing_account).

## Agora's policy of 10,000 free-of-charge minutes

Agora gives each [Agora Account](https://console.agora.io/) 10,000 free-of-charge minutes each month, and deducts the minutes in the following sequence: 

1. Audio minutes
2. On-premise recording audio minutes
3. Cloud recording audio minutes 
4. Video minutes HD
5. On-premise recording video minutes HD
6. Cloud recording video minutes HD
7. Video minutes HD+
8. On-premise recording video minutes HD+
9. Cloud recording video minutes HD+

If your total service minutes do not exceed 10,000 minutes, the service is free of charge; after the 10,000 free-of-charge minutes are deducted, Agora charges you for the remaining service minutes.

<div class="alert note">The remaining free-of-charge minutes will be cleared at the end of each month.</div>

## Calculate service minutes


Agora adds up the [audio minutes](#amin) used by the projects under your [Agora Account](https://console.agora.io/) on a monthly basis.

### <a name="amin"></a>Audio minutes 

If you deduct the time that a user receives the video streams in the channel from the total time that the user stays in the channel, you get the audio minutes of that user, regardless of whether that user subscribes to any audio stream. 

<div class="alert note"><li>Your audio minutes do not add up, even if you subscribe to multiple audio streams. </li><li>See <a href="#billing">Pricing</a> for the pricing information of the audio minutes. </li></div>

## Q&A



<details>
	<summary><font color="#3ab7f8">Question: Are the audio minutes on my bill for a specific user?</font></summary>

No. The audio minutes that you see on your bill are the sum of the audio minutes used by all users under your Agora account. In other words, the audio minutes are <i>not</i> for a specific user or for users in a specific channel.
