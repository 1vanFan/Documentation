# Conduct a Last Mile Test
## Introduction

You can conduct a last mile network quality test before starting a call to check if the network supports the audio bitrate or target bitrate of the chosen video profile before a user joins a channel. The `onLastmileQuality` callback reports the test results once every two seconds. The test results are based on the network quality ratings determined by the packet-loss rates and network jitter, which reflect the uplink network quality of the client.

> The audio SDK uses a fixed bitrate of 48 Kbps. 
> The video SDK adjusts the actual bitrate according to the chosen video profile.



## Implementation 

```C++
// Implement the onLastmileQuality callback. 
void onLastmileQuality(int quality) {
 		// quality means the detected network quality type. You can use it for the related logic. 
		// ⑴ You can choose to end the last mile test in the callback. 
}

// Enable the last mile test at an appropriate time and before joining a channel. 
int ret = lpAgoraEngine->enableLastmileTest();

	// ⑵ You can also choose to end the last mile test at any time. Before the test ends, the onLastmileQuality callback can be returned multiple times. 
int ret = lpAgoraEngine->disableLastmileTest();

```

## Considerations

- You can conduct a last mile test only before joining a channel.
- The `onLastmileQuality` callback may return UNKNOWN the first time it is triggered. Subsequent callbacks will return the test results.
