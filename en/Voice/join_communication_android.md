# Join a Channel
Before joining the channel, ensure that you have finished preparing the development environment. See [Integrate the SDK](../../en/Voice/android_audio.md) for more information.

You need to set the channel profile before the app joins a channel.

## Set the channel profile as Communication
After initializing the Agora engine, call the `setChannelProfile` method to set the channel profile. The Agora engine applies optimization according to the channel profile.

In the `setChannelProfile` method, set the channel profile as Communication. This profile applies to voice or video calls, such as one-to-one or group calls, where all users in the channel can talk freely. The Communication profile is the default setting.

> -   Call the `setChannelProfile` method before joining a channel.
> -   One engine can be specified one profile only. If you want to switch to another profile, destroy the current engine using the `destroy` method and create a new engine before calling the `setChannelProfile` method for setting the new channel profile.


```
mRtcEngine.setChannelProfile(Constants.CHANNEL_PROFILE_COMMUNICATION);
```


## Join a communication channel
Call the `joinChannel` method to join a channel. 

In the `joinChannel` method:

-   Pass a token that can identify the role and privilege of the user. Set token as null for low security requirements. A token is generated at the server of the application. For how to generate a token, see [Security Keys](../../en/Voice/token.md).
-   Pass a channel ID that can identify the channel. Users that input the same channel ID enter into the same channel.
-   Pass a uid that can identify the user. Every user in a channel requires a unique uid. If you want to join the same channel on different devices, ensure that different uids are used for each device.

> Once in a channel, a user must call the `leaveChannel` method to exit the current channel before entering another channel.

```
 private void joinChannel() {
    mRtcEngine.joinChannel(null, "demoChannel1", "Extra Optional Data", 0); // if you do not specify the uid, Agora will assign one.
}
```

Now that you are in the channel, you can start an audio call by [Publishing and Subscribing to Streams](../../en/Voice/publish_android_audio.md).
