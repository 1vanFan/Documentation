# Publish and Subscribe to Streams
Before publishing or subscribing to any streams, ensure that you have finished preparing the development environment and joined the channel. See [Integrate the SDK](../../en/Voice/windows_video.md) for more information.

## Implementation
The audio function of the Agora SDK for Windows is enabled by default. Users can subscribe to and publish audio streams without calling any other API methods once the users have joined the channel.

## Next Steps
You are now in a voice call. When the call ends, use the Agora SDK to exit the current call:

- [Leave the Channel](../../en/Voice/leave_windows.md)

For added requirements on the audio volume, audio effect or voice pitch, you can alse take the following steps:

- [Adjust the volume](../../en/Voice/volume_windows.md)
- [Play the Audio Effects/Audio Mixing](../../en/Voice/effect_mixing_windows.md)
- [Adjust the Pitch and Tone](../../en/Voice/voice_effect_windows.md)
