# Agora Voice Overview
The Agora Native SDK for Voice Call enables easy and convenient one-to-one or one-to-many **voice-only** calls. With a small SDK package size, the Agora Native SDK for Voice Call is applicable to a variety of recreational and business activities.

The difference between an Agora Voice Call and [Agora Voice Interactive Broadcast](https://docs.agora.io/en/Audio%20Broadcast/product_live_audio?platform=All%20Platforms) is: 
* An Agora Voice Call prioritizes smoothness and low latency. All users are the same role and can talk to each other freely. A typical scenario of an Agora Voice Call is a voice conference call for many persons.
* An Agora Voice Interactive Broadcast prioritizes high voice quality. Users can be the host or audience, where only the host can talk. A user who wants to talk must change the role to a host. A typical scenario of the Agora Voice Interactive Broadcast is an online trivia game.
