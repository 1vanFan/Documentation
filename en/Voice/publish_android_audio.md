# Publish and Subscribe to Streams
Before publishing or subscribing to any streams, ensure that you have finished preparing the development environment and joined the channel. See [Integrate the SDK](../../en/Voice/android_video.md) for more information.

The audio function of the Agora SDK for Android is enabled by default. Users can subscribe to and publish audio streams without calling any other API methods once they have joined the channel.

During publishing or subscribing to other streams, you can use the Agora SDK to implement the following functions:
* [Adjust the volume](../../cn/Video/volume_android.md)
* [Play the Audio Effects/Audio Mixing](../../cn/Video/effect_mixing_android.md)
* [Use In-ear Monitoring](../../cn/Video/in-ear_android.md)
* [Adjust the Pitch and Tone](../../cn/Video/voice_effect_android.md)
