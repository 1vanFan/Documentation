## Real-time Messaging vs. Signaling

The Agora Real-time Messaging system (RTM) is designed to replace the legacy Signaling system. We are dedicated to lauching an real-time messaging with features way beyond the above-mentioned ones. 

Our plan: 

- Features including user property, channel property, offline peer-to-peer message, and history messages are coming by the end of May, 2019. 
- Interoperability between the Agora RTM system and the Agora Signaling system will be implemented by the end of June, 2019. 
- Maintenance to the legacy Signaling system will cease by the end of 2019.
