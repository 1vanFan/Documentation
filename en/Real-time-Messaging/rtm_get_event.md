# Real-time Messaging RESTful API
> Besides this document, you can also read our interactive document [RTM RESTful API](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/restfulapi/)![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1583736328279). By clicking the **Example Value** or **Schema** tab, you can view example codes or parameter definitions for request/response bodies.

The Real-time Messaging RESTful API currently supports user events and channel events.

<div class="alert note">For the user events and channel events RESTful API, the number of requests per second for each App ID must not exceed 10.</div>

## <a name="auth"></a>Authentication

Agora RTM RESTful API supports HTTPS only. You can use either of the following methods to authenticate your HTTP request: 

- [Basic authentication](#basicauth)
- [Token authentication](#tokenauth)

### <a name="basicauth"></a>Basic authentication

You need to pass the basic HTTP authentication and put `api_key:api_secret` in the `Authorization` field of the HTTP header: 

- `api_key`: Customer ID
- `api_secret`: Customer Certificate

You can get your Customer ID and Customer Certificate on the [RESTful API](https://console.agora.io/restful) page of the Agora Console. For more information on how to generate the `Authorization` filed, see [RESTful API authentication](https://docs.agora.io/en/faq/restful_authentication).

### <a name="tokenauth"></a>Token authentication

If you have already generated an RTM Token on your server, you can use token authentication. You need to put the following information to the `x-agora-token` field `x-agora-uid` field when sending your HTTP request: 

- The RTM Token generated at your server. 
- The uid you use to generate the RTM Token. 

**Sample code**

The following sample code shows how to implement token authentication in Java:

```java
  Request request = new Request.Builder()
  ...
  // Puts your RTM Token to the `x-agora-token` field of the HTTP request. 
  .addHeader("x-agora-token", "<Your RTM Token>")
  // Puts the uid, which generates the RTM token, to the `x-agora-uid` field of the HTTP request.
  .addHeader("x-agora-uid", "<Your uid used to generate the RTM Token>")
  ...
```

> For more information about how to generate an RTM Token, see [Token Security](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/rtm_token?platform=All%20Platforms).

## Data format

All requests are sent to the host: `api.agora.io`.

- Base URL: 

```
https://api.agora.io/dev/v2/project/<appid>/
```

- Content-type: `application/json;charset=utf-8`
- Authorization: See [Authentication](#auth). 
- Request: See the examples in the following APIs. 
- Response: The response content is in JSON format. 

> All the request URLs and request bodies are case sensitive. 

## API sequence

- Get user events: Call `user_events`.
- Get channel events: Call `channel_events`.

## Status code

The following table contains the most common HTTP status codes for Real-time Messaging.

| Status code | Description                                                  |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|200         | The request succeeds. |
|400         | Incorrect request syntax. |
|408         | The server request times out or the server fails to respond. |

## <a name="get"></a>Gets user events

This method gets the user events from the address specified by the Agora RTM server. 

> - The number of requests per second for each App ID must not exceed 10.
> - The RTM backend stores a maximum of 2,000 events.
> - The backend returns a maximum of 1,000 events each time.
> - Agora does not guarantee the time sequence of events across geographical regions (countries or continents), because Agora stores events by geographical regions.
> - If you have pulled events from one geographical region, you may get the same events when you pull from a different geographical region. This is because Agora only synchronize events within a geographical region and does not synchronize events across geographical regions.

- Method: GET
