# Get user and channel events
You can now get both user and channel events with the Agora RTM RESTful APIs. 

<div class="alert note">qps of the RESTful APIs: 100 (for each vendor).</div>


## <a name="auth"></a>Authentication

Agora RTM RESTful API supports HTTPS only. You can use either of the following to authenticate your HTTP request: 

- [Basic Authentication](#basicauth)
- [Token Authentication](#tokenauth)

### <a name="basicauth"></a>Basic Authentication

You need to pass the basic HTTP authentication and put `api_key:api_secret` into the `Authorization` field of the HTTP header: 

- `api_key`: Customer ID
- `api_secret`: Customer Certificate

You can get your Customer ID and Customer Certificate on the [RESTful API](https://console.agora.io/restful) page of the Agora Console. For more information on how to generate the `Authorization` filed, see [RESTful API authentication](https://docs.agora.io/en/faq/restful_authentication).

### <a name="tokenauth"></a>Token Authentication

If you have already generated an RTM Token on your server, you can use Token Authentication. You need to put the following information to the `x-agora-token` field `x-agora-uid` field when sending your HTTP request: 

- The RTM Token generated at your server. 
- The uid you use to generate the RTM Token. 

**Sample code**

```java
  Request request = new Request.Builder()
  ...
  // Puts your RTM Token to the `x-agora-token` field of the HTTP request. 
  .addHeader("x-agora-token", "<Your RTM Token>")
  // Puts the uid, which generates the RTM token, to the `x-agora-uid` field of the HTTP request.
  .addHeader("x-agora-uid", "<Your uid used to generate the RTM Token>")
  ...
```

> For more information about how to generate an RTM Token, see [Token Security](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/rtm_token?platform=All%20Platforms).

> - The RTM backend stores a maximum of 2,000 events. 
> - The backend returns a maximum of 1,000 events each time. 
> - We do not guarantee the time sequence of events across geographies, because we store events by regions. 
> - If you have pulled events from one region, you may get the same events when you pull from a different region. This is because we only synchronize events within a region and do not synchronize events across regions.
