# Agora Signaling Sunset Plan
## Agora Signaling Sunset Plan

-  As of August 1st, 2019, the Agora Signaling system will enter the sunset phase. We will not add new features during this period, but only fix reported bugs. As of August 12, 2019, all related documents will be moved [here](https://docs.agora.io/en/Signaling/product_signaling?platform=All%20Platforms).
- As of December 31st, we will stop updating the Agora Signaling system, and only ensure that the Agora Signaling SDK can function in the interim. 
- On June 30, 2020, we will put an end to our Signaling service and shut down the Signaling servers.

## Compatibility between the Signaling SDK and the Agora RTM SDK

Agora RTM SDK v1.0 is compatible with the legacy Agora Signling SDK except for the following features or versions.  Our Dashboard will soon send you a note about this if you are using features that the Agora RTM SDK does not support. Please keep tuned.
