# Agora Signaling Sunset Plan
## Agora Signaling Sunset Plan

-  As of August 1, 2019, the Agora Signaling system will be sunset. No new features will be added, and only bug fixes will be made. 
-  As of August 12, 2019, all related documents will be moved [here](https://docs.agora.io/en/Signaling/product_signaling?platform=All%20Platforms).
- As of December 31, 2019, we will stop updating the  legacy Agora Signaling system, but will maintain the system in operation mode. 
- On June 30, 2020, we will shut down the signaling servers and the signaling service will end.

## Compatibility between the Signaling SDK and the Agora RTM SDK

Agora RTM SDK v1.0 is compatible with the legacy Agora Signling SDK except for the following features or versions. Expect messages to appear on the Dashboard if you are using features that the Agora RTM SDK does not support.
