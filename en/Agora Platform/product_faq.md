### Does Agora use WebRTC?

Agora uses its own high-resolution audio codec and audio/video pre- and post-processing modules, which provide you with high-quality application voice and video experiences. In web browser solutions, the Agora Web SDK is based on WebRTC. However, the Agora Native SDK is not based on WebRTC.

If you are using WebRTC or require other customized solutions, contact sales-us@agora.io.
