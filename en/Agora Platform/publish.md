Publishing is the action of sending the user's audio and/or video data to the channel. Usually, the published object is a media stream created by the audio data sampled from a microphone and/or the video data captured by a camera. Developers can also publish media streams from other sources, including an online music file and the user's screen.

After publishing succeeds, the SDK continues sending media data to other users in the channel. By publishing one's stream and subscribing to others' streams, users have real-time voice or video calls with each other.
