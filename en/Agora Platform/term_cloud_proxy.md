# Cloud Proxy
Cloud Proxy is a proxy service that enables users to connect to Agora services through a firewall by using fixed IP addresses.

In network environments with firewalls, developers can use the Agora Cloud Proxy service to connect through the firewall. By adding specified IP addresses and ports to the firewall whitelist, developers can access Agora service from an intranet. 

See *Use Cloud Proxy* for details:
