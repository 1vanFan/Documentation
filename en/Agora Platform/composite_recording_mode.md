# composite recording mode
Composite recording mode generates a single mixed audio and video file for all UIDs in a channel. It is one of the recording modes for both On-premise Recording and Cloud Recording.

For example, if there are three UIDs sending audio and video in a channel, composite recording mode generates a single mixed audio and video file.

> On-premise recording also enables developers to generate a separate audio and video file for all UIDs in a channel, instead of combining audio and video into a single file.
