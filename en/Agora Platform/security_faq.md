### How does the Agora network handle DDoS attacksï¼Ÿ

Agora regularly scans the core network nodes, check, and clean up possible security vulnerabilities. An anti-DDoS firewall is also implemented on each cloud data center to protect core nodes from any attack. In our global data centers, Agora reserves over 50% of redundancy bandwidth for core servers with sufficient capacity and resources to control the risk of DDoS.

### Do Agora servers store any voice or video content?

No, Agora servers do not store any voice or video content. Agora SDKs send some information to Agora servers for quality and problem reporting purposes. This information includes records of the date, time, and duration of the call, and failure records. Agora does not collect information that affects privacy.
