# individual recording mode
Individual recording mode records audio and video of each UID as separate files. It is one of the recording modes for both On-premise Recording and Cloud Recording.

For example, if there are three UIDs sending audio and video in a channel, individual recording mode generates three audio files and three video files.

Developers can use Agora's Audio & Video File Merging script to merge the audio and video files of each UID. See [Merge Audio and Video Files](https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_merge_files) (Cloud Recording) or [Use the Transcoding Script](https://docs.agora.io/en/Recording/recording_merge_files) (On-premise Recording) for details.
