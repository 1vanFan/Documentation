# media stream
A media stream is an object that contains media data.

Media streams can have the following types of media data:
* Audio streams: Audio data only.
* Video streams: Video data only.
* Audio and video streams: Both audio and video data.

Media streams are transmitted through Agora RTC [channels](../../en/Agora%20Platform/terms.md). In an RTC channel, users can [publish](../../en/Agora%20Platform/terms.md) local streams and [subscribe](../../en/Agora%20Platform/terms.md) to remote streams.

Normally, a user can only publish one media stream, and the user ID corresponds to the published stream. If developers enable [dual-stream mode](../../en/Agora%20Platform/terms.md), the SDK automatically publishes an extra low-quality video stream.
