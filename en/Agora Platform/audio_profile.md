# audio profile
An audio profile includes the sample rate, encoding scheme, number of channels, and bitrate for encoded audio data.

Agora provides APIs for developers to set the audio profile for encoded audio data under ideal network conditions. The local user sends the encoded audio streams to remote users, so the setting of the audio profile influences the data received by remote users.
