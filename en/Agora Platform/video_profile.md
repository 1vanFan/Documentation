# video profile
The video profile refers to a set of video attributes, such as resolution, bitrate, and frame rate. It is also known as "video encoder configurations". 

Agora provides methods for developers to set the resolution, bitrate, frame rate, orientation mode, and other attributes under ideal network conditions when encoding the local video. Once encoded, the local video streams to the remote users in the channel. The settings of the video profile affect what the remote users see.
