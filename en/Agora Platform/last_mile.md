# last mile
The last mile refers to the network between the Agora edge server and the end user's device:
- The upstream last mile refers to the network from the end user's device to the Agora edge server.
- The downstream last mile refers to the network from the Agora edge server to the end user's device. 

The network quality of the last mile affects the frame rate and image sharpness of the media stream that a user sends or receives.
