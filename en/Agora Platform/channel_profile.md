# channel profile
The channel profile is a configuration that Agora uses to apply optimized algorithms for different real-time scenarios. Agora RTC channels support two channel profiles:
* Communication profile: Prioritizes smoothness. Applicable to scenarios that require low latency and minimal freezes, such as voice calls and video conferences.
* Live-broadcasting profile: Prioritizes quality. Applicable to scenarios that require high audio and video quality, such as interactive audio broadcasting and video broadcasting.
