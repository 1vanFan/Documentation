# On-premise Recording
On-premise Recording is a component provided by Agora for recording and saving voice and video calls and interactive broadcasts on a Linux server.

On-premise Recording enables developers to record, transfer and store audio and video data on a local server. For this reason, On-premise Recording is useful in high-security scenarios, such as surveillance and internal government or enterprise communications.

The On-premise Recording SDK is compatible with the Agora RTC SDK. It supports two recording modes: [Individual](https://docs.agora.io/en/Recording/recording_individual_mode) and [composite](https://docs.agora.io/en/Recording/recording_composite_mode). Developers can record communications either directly from the [command line](https://docs.agora.io/en/Recording/recording_cmd_cpp?platform=Linux%20CPP)or by [calling APIs](https://docs.agora.io/en/Recording/recording_api_cpp?platform=Linux). On-premise Recording offers additional advanced features such as adding [watermarks](https://docs.agora.io/en/Recording/recording_watermark_cpp) and [capturing screenshots](https://docs.agora.io/en/Recording/recording_screen_capture).
