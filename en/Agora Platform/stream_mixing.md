# stream mixing
Stream mixing means combining multiple media streams into one. It may include the mixing of video streams (video mixing) and audio streams (audio mixing).

RTMP converter uses stream mixing to push the streams of multiple hosts to CDN. Composite recording mode uses stream mixing in Agora Cloud Recording and Agora On-premise Recording.
