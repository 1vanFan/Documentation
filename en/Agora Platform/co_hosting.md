# co-hosting
Co-hosting describes a scenario with more than one host. All hosts can interact with each other. The audience can hear and see these hosts.

There are two possible scenarios:

- Co-hosting in a channel. It can either be multiple hosts joining a channel, or an audience switching user role and becoming a co-host when another host is already present.
- Co-hosting across channels. The Agora RTC SDK supports relaying the media stream of a host in one channel to other channels. For details, see [Co-host across Channels](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/media_relay_android).

For the maximum number of co-hosts possible in a channel, see [How many users can Agora RTC SDK support at the same time?](https://docs.agora.io/en/faqs/capacity) A channel with too many co-hosts may cause network latency and packet loss. Refer to [Video for 7+ Users](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/multi_user_video_android) to ensure communication quality.
