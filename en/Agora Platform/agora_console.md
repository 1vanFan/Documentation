# Agora Console
Agora Console is a site for developers to manage Agora projects and services.

Agora Console provides an intuitive interface for developers to make payments, query, manage and accomplish other operations when using Agora services. After registering an Agora account, developers can use the following main features:

- Manage the account
- Check and manage Agora projects and services
- Get an App ID
- Check call quality and usage
- Check billing and make payments
- Manage members and roles

Agora also provides RESTful APIs, so developers can implement some of the above features directly, such as create a project and fetch usage numbers.
