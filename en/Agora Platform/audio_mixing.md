# audio mixing
Audio mixing means combining multiple audio streams into one. Common scenarios of audio mixing include:

- During a call, if a user plays a music file while speaking, the Agora RTC SDK mixes the two audio streams, and all other users in the channel hear both the voice and the music.
- In composite recording mode, the recorded file contains the mixed audio of all or specified users in a channel.
