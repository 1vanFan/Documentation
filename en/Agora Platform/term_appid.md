# App ID
An App ID is a randomly generated string provided by Agora and is the unique identifier of an app. When developers create an Agora project in [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io/), the App ID is automatically generated to identify the project.


When initializing an Agora service, developers need to pass an App ID as an argument. Agora uses App IDs to provide billing, management, statistical data, and other services.

For situations requiring high security, such as in a production environment, Agora recommends using a token for user authentication; otherwise, the environment is open to anyone who has the App ID.
