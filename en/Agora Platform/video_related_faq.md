## Unable to Turn On the Camera

1. Check whether the camera access permission is enabled. Both Android and iOS systems have a runtime access permission function under System Settings. Additionally, some security software on Android manages camera access permissions.
2. Check whether another application is using the camera. Close all applications, restart your phone, and try again.
3. Check whether there is any camera hardware issue. Start the built-in video camera to test whether you can record.

## The Screen Goes Blank or Freezes in a Call

It may be caused by the following scenarios:

* Network Issues: If the local network connection is poor or interrupted, you do not see the other users. If any user in the call has network issues, none of the other users in the call will see this user.
* The screen goes blank when you disable the video.
