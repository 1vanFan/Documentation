# App Certificate
An App Certificate is a randomly generated string provided by Agora for enabling token authentication. It is one of the required arguments for generating a token.

It is important to safeguard the developer App ID and App Certificate, as they are used to implement real-time audio and video functions in apps. All charges are applied to the developer's account. Agora recommends storing the App Certificate on the business sever, not on the client.
