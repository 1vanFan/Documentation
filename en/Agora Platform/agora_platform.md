# Agora Platform Overview
## SD-RTN



SD-RTN \(Software Defined Real-time Network\) is a “smart” network that relies on cloud computing technology and is dedicated to the transmission of real-time audio and video services worldwide, covering 200+ countries worldwide. As a layer of PaaS \(Platform as a Service\) that provides real-time audio and video services, SD-RTN focuses on the network infrastructure capabilities of audio and video services for upper-layer \(SaaS\) services, solving common problems for developers, creating a friendly development environment and enabling agile development.

-   Global network coverage:
    -   Covering 200+ countries
    -   Covering 100+ telecommunication providers in China
-   Mass access capability:
    -   Supports multiple intelligent terminal access
    -   A single channel can support 50,000 people online at the same time
-   QoS (Quality of Service) capability enhancement:
    -   Prevents network congestion in advance
    -   Weak network anti-loss guarantee
-   QoS-based dynamic routing:
    -   Comprehensive assessment of network resources
    -   QoS optimal path guarantee
-   SLA (Service Level Agreement) guarantee:
    -   Multi-service SLA protection
    -   After-sales business support
-   Global network reliability:
    -   Global network availability: 99.999%
    -   Invisible core business, such as anti-DDoS
    -   More than 99% global 5-second landing success rate
-   End-to-end network guaranteed an average delay of less than 76 ms:
    -   Last mile access algorithm optimization: Full platform, full interoperability
    -   Support for iOS & 5000+ Android terminals
    -   Support for iOS, Android, Windows, MacOS, Linux, CoCos, Unity, and so on.
-   UDP (User Datagram Protocol) optimization:
    -   Optimizes multiple private protocols based on the UDP
-   Self-developed audio and video codecs:
    -   Efficient use of network resources
    -   Self-developed SOLO, NOVA codecs
-   Anti-packet-loss optimization:
    -   Algorithm for optimizing anti-packet-loss mechanism under weak network conditions


## Audio

High fidelity, 3D surround sound experience:
-   48-kHz full-band acquisition: Highly restored acoustic sound
-   3A algorithm based on machine learning: Echo cancellation, automatic gain, noise suppression
-   Hearing enhancement: Two-channel, 3D surround sound, sound localization, audio mixing, reverberation effects, in-ear monitor, voice change


## Video

Immersive visual experience:
-   Continuous network detection: Network detection before and after encoding, network friendly
-   Dynamic network flow control: Maintains a dynamic balance of network bandwidth resources
-   Highly efficient anti-loss coding products: Optimized coding algorithm, smooth video transmission, prevents network impact
-  Packet loss compensation: Automatically repairs the content to ensure the experience
-   Visual enhancement: Image enhancement based on machine learning


## Agora SDK

The Agora SDK is designed to be flexible in incorporating the SDK in real-time applications such as IoT, educational, social, financial, and network acceleration.

-   API Usage Guide and Use Cases
-   Productized core module: More customized, split the original SDK on demand
-   Modular audio and video processing interface: Easier to integrate third-party SDKs


### Agora Native SDK

The Agora Native SDK is available to developers on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac platforms. The Agora Native SDK has all the necessary voice and video codecs built-in, along with the logic to access the Agora Global Network and automatically respond to network disconnections and varying network conditions. Developers simply need the provided high-level API methods. Everything else is built in.

### Agora Web SDK

The Agora Web SDK enables the development of web applications with virtually the same functionalities as the native applications developed with the Agora Native SDK.
