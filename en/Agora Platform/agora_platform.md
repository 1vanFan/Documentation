# Agora Platform Overview
## SD-RTN



SD-RTN \(Software Defined Real-time Network\) is a “smart” network that relies on cloud computing technology and is dedicated to the transmission of real-time audio and video services worldwide, covering 200+ countries worldwide. As a layer of PaaS \(Platform as a Service\) that provides real-time audio and video services, SD-RTN focuses on the network infrastructure capabilities of audio and video services for upper-layer \(SaaS\) services, solving common problems for developers, creating a friendly development environment and enabling agile development.

## Agora SDK

The Agora SDK is designed to be flexible in incorperating the SDK to real-time applications such as IoT, education, social, financial, and network acceleration.

-   API Usage Guide and Use Cases

-   Productized core module: more customized, split the original SDK on demand

-   Modular audio and video processing interface: easier to integrate third-party SDK


### The Agora Native SDK

The Agora Native SDK is available to developers on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac platforms. It has all the necessary voice and video codecs built-in, along with the logic to access the Agora Global Network and automatically respond to disconnections and varying network conditions. Developers simply need the provided high-level APIs. Everything else is built in.

### The Agora Web SDK

The Agora Web SDK enables the development of web apps that have virtually the same functionalities as native apps developed with the Native SDK.
