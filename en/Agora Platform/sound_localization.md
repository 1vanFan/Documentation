# sound localization
Sound localization means determining the distance to and direction of a sound through hearing the difference of volume, time, and timbre between users' ears.

To implement sound localization, developers can add audio gain and phase into an audio signal to associate the userâ€™s position in a sound field.

Sound localization is widely applied in video games. For example, in MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) games, players can perceive the distance to and direction of another player by the sound of their footsteps.
