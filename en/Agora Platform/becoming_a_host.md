# host (becoming)
Becoming a host describes a scenario within a live-broadcast channel (the channel profile is live broadcast) when an audience switches the user role and becomes a host (broadcaster).

If there is already a host in the channel, the new host becomes a co-host. This new host or co-host can publish audio and video streams. All users in the channel hear and see this co-host.
