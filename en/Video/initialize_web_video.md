# Create and Initialize a Client
## Prerequisites

Before creating and initizing the client, ensure that you prepared the development environment. See [Integrate the SDK](../../en/Video/web_prepare.md).

Create a project in Agora Dashboard and get the App ID of the project. You need to pass in the App ID during initialization.

1. Sign up for a developer account at [Agora Dashboard](https://dashboard.agora.io/). See [Sign in and Sign up](../../en/Video/sign_in_and_sign_up.md).

2. Click **Get Started** under **Projects**.

3. Input your project name in the pop-up window and click **Create**. Follow the on-screen instructions to get to know the basic steps to start a video call. Once the project is created, you can find it under **Projects**.

4. Click the **Edit** button behind the new project, or the **Project Management** button ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1551254998344) in the left navigation menu to go to the **Project Management** page.

## Implementation

### Create a Client
Use the `AgoraRTC.createClient` method to create a client object. Set the mode and codec parameters. 

```javascript
var client = AgoraRTC.createClient({mode: 'live', codec: "h264"});
```

### Initialize the Client
After creating the client, pass the project App ID to the `client.init` method to initialize the client.

```javascript
client.init(<APPID>, function () {
  console.log("AgoraRTC client initialized");

}, function (err) {
  console.log("AgoraRTC client init failed", err);
});
```

> Ensure that you call the `create` and `client.init` methods to intiialize the AgoraRtcEngine before calling any other API. 

## Next Steps
You hava created the Client and can start a voice call with the following steps:
- [Join a Channel](../../en/Video/join_video_web.md)
- [Publish and Subscribe to Streams](../../en/Video/publish_web.md)

To check the network connection or audio quality before joining a channel, you can refer to the following sections.
- [Set the Stereo/High-fidelity Audio Profile](../../en/Video/audio_profile_web.md)
