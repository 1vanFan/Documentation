# Agora Video Overview
The Agora Native SDK for Video Call enables easy and convenient one-to-one or one-to-many calls and supports voice-only and video modes.

The difference between an Agora Video Call and [Agora Video Interactive Broadcast](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/product_live?platform=All%20Platforms) is: 
* An Agora Video Call prioritizes fluency and low latency. All users are the same role and can talk to each other freely. A typical scenario of an Agora Video Call is a video conference call for many persons. 
* An Agora Video Interactive Broadcast prioritizes high voice quality. Users can be the host or audience, where only the host can talk. A user who wants to talk must change the role to a host. A typical scenario of an Agora Video Interactive Broadcast is an interactive online class.
