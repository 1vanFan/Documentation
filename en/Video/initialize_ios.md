# Create and Initialize an AgoraRtcEngine Instance
Before creating an AgoraRtcEngine instance, ensure that you have finished preparing the development environment. See [Integrate the SDK](../../cn/Voice/ios_audio.md) for more information.

## Implementation

Create an AgoraRtcEngine instance by invoking `sharedEngineWithAppId` before joining a live broadcast channel.

In this method:

- Pass the Agora App ID. Only applications with the same App ID can join the same channel.
- Specify a delegate object. The Agora SDK uses the delegate object to inform the application of Agora engine runtime events, such as joining or leaving a channel and adding new users into the channel.

```objective-c
//Objective-C
#import <AgoraRtcEngineKit/AgoraRtcEngineKit.h>

...

- (void)initializeAgoraEngine {
  self.agoraKit = [AgoraRtcEngineKit sharedEngineWithAppId:@"Your App ID" delegate:self];
}
```

```swift
//Swift
import AgoraRtcEngineKit

...

func initializeAgoraEngine() {
   agoraKit = AgoraRtcEngineKit.sharedEngine(withAppId: "Your App ID", delegate: self)
}
```

## More Steps
You have now finished creating the AgoraRtcEngine instance and can start a voice call with the following steps:
* [Join a Channel](../../cn/Voice/join_communication_ios.md)
* [Publish and Subscribe to Streams](../../cn/Voice/publish_ios_audio.md)

For added requirements on network connection or audio quality, you can also take the following steps before joining a channel:
* [Conduct a Last mile Test](../../cn/Voice/lastmile_ios.md)
* [Set the Stereo/High-fidelity Audio Profile](../../cn/Voice/audio_profile_ios_audio.md)
