# Billing, Fee Deduction, and Account Suspension
The Agora Console issues billing information and deduces a fee from your account monthly. Note the actions that take place on the following dates:

- First day of each month: The release date. Console issues your billing information via Email.
- Sixth day of each month: The deduction date. The Console deduces the fee from your account and notifies you via Email.
- Thirtieth day since the deduction date: The account suspension date. If your account balance remains negative, Agora will suspend your account and notify you via Email. 

> None of the above applies if you have signed a contract with Agora. The contract overrides all finance information such as billing, deduction and suspension details.

## Billing

The Agora Console issues billing information on the First day of each month. The billing period is one calendar month.

Go to Agora Console, click the **Finance** icon![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1562666103550) on the left navigational panel. Click **Bills** to view the detailed billing information of your projects, including billing period, due date and amount.

## Fee Deduction

On the deduction date, the Agora Console automatically deduces a fee for the previous month and notifies you via Email. If your account balance is negative after the deduction, Agora will send you an Email, reminding you to top up your account at your earliest convenience to avoid account suspension. 

## Account suspension

If your account balance is negative for 30 days since the deduction date, Agora suspends your account. Then none of your projects can access Agora's services. 

If this happens, please top up your account at your earliest convenience. Once your balance &ge; 0 , Agora will unfreeze your account.
