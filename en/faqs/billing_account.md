# Billing, Due Deduction, and Account Suspension
The Agora Dashboard issues billing information and deduces the payment from your account on a monthly basis. Pay attention to the following dates:

- 1<sup>st</sup> day of each month: The release date. Dashboard issues your billing information via Email.
- 6<sup>th</sup> day of each month: The deduction date. The Dashboard deduces the fee from your account and notifies you of this via Email.
- 30<sup>th</sup> day since the deduction date: The account suspension date. If your account balance is not enough for paying off the bill, Agora will suspend your account and notify you of this via Email. 

> If you have signed a contract with Agora, the contract overrides all finance information such as billing, deduction and suspension details.

## Due deduction

On the deduction date, Agora automatically deduces from your account your dues for last month and notifies you of this via Email. If your account balance is negative after the deduction, Agora will Email you, reminding you to top up your account at your earliest convenience to avoid account suspension. 

## Account suspension

If your account balance is negative for 30 days since the deduction date, Agora suspends your account. Then none of your projects can access Agora's services. 

Please top up your account at your earliest convenience. Once your balance &ge; 0 , Agora will unfreeze your account.
