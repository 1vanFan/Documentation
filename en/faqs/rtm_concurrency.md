# Does Agora RTM SDK have a limit on the number of online users?
The Agora RTM SDK does not have a limit on the number of online users or on the number of concurrent members in a single channel. 

- If the number of members in a channel is below 1,000, we recommend keeping your ongoing channel messages below 200 per second. 
- If the number is below 10,000, we recommend keeping your ongoing channel messages below 100 per second. 
- if the number is above 10,000, we recommend that you keep your ongoing channel messages below 30 and contact our support team to sort out a customized solution.
