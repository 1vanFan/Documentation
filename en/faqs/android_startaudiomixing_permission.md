# Why can't I play the background music using startAudioMixing on Android 10?
## Issue description

Cannot play an mp3, mp4, or any other music format using `startAudioMixing` on Android 10.

## Reason

This is caused by an Android permission limit. If `targetSdkVersion` &ge; 29, you need to add relevant app privileges to play the a music file.

## Solution

For Android projects with `targetSdkVersion` &ge; 29, add the following line in the `application` zone of the AndroidManifest.xml file to play the music file:

```xml
<application
   Android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true">
   â€¦
</application>
```
