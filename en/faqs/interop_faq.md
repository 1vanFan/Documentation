# How do I use the Agora Web SDK to interoperate with the Agora Native SDK?
- In the communication profile, interoperability is enabled by default.
- In the live broadcast profile, call the `enableWebSdkInteroperability` method in the Agora Native SDK. See [Enable Interoperability](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/interop_web?platform=Web) for details.
