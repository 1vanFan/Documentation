# Why have I been charged for HD+ video minutes, even though all the users subscribe only to video streams with resolution of 360 x 640?
The aggregate resolution is a sum of all the resolutions of the video streams to which a user subscribes. That said, the more video streams a user subscribes to, the more likely that user's aggregate resolution falls into the HD+ bracket ( > 1280 x 720).
