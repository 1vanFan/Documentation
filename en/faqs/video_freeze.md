# Video freeze occurs in a call.
Choppy videos may be caused by slow Internet connections or bad device performances. 

## Step 1: Self-check

Check the following:

* Check if the choppy videos are intermittent or consistent. Intermittent choppy videos are normal due to the nature of the network and device.
* Check if the Internet connection is stable. If it is stable but the video is still choppy, switch to 4G or another Wi-Fi network and check the video performance.
* Try the video call on another device.
* Turn off all pre-processing options, such as image enhancement, to ensure that the choppy video is not caused by any pre-processing option.

## Step 2: Contact Agora Customer Support

If the issue persists, contact Agora customer support and submit the issue with the following information:
* The uid of the user who sees the choppy video playback (in a live broadcast, whether the user is the host or audience).
* The time frame during which the choppy video playback appears.
* SDK logs and screen recording files of the user.
