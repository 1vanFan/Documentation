# Does Agora charge the screen capture function separately?
We do not charge the screen capture function separately. Screen capture is just a different form of the recording function. The recording service has to join the corresponding channel and subscribe to the specified video streams all the time in order to capture screens at the specified interval. Therefore, if you have enabled the screen capture function, we charge you for the full-time recording of the corresponding stream, but do do charge you for the screen capture function separately.
