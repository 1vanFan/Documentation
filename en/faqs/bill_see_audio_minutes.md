# Why do I see audio minutes in my bill even though all users subscribe to video streams?
Chances are: <ul><li>The user being subscribed to has not subscribed in turn to any other video stream.</li><li>After subscribing to a video stream, a user has not received any video stream due to poor network conditions or issues on the host side. </li></ul> If either of these conditions occurs, the corresponding user's aggregate resolution is 0 and the user's service time counts as audio minutes.
