# Where are the recorded files stored?
If you use the Agora On-premise Recording service, the recorded files will be stored on your Linux server. For more information, see [Manage the Recording Files](../../en/Recording/recording_files.md). 

If you use the Agora Cloud Recording service, Agora will automatically split the recorded contents into multiple TS files and upload them to the third-party cloud storage that you provide (Amazon S3 or Alibaba). For more information, see [Manage Recorded Files](../../en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_manage_files.md).
