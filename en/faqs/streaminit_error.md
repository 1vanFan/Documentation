# Why do errors occur when calling the Stream.init method?
The following are common errors when initializing the stream:

- NotAllowedError: The user refuses to grant access to the video or audio resource.
- NotFoundError: Cannot find the specified media track. Ensure that your media device is working.
- SecurityError: Use HTTPS for your web app.

See [`Stream.init`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/API%20Reference/web/interfaces/agorartc.stream.html#init) for more errors.
