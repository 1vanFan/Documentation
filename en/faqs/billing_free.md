# Agora's free-of-charge policy for the first 10,000 minutes
Agora's real-time communications include:

* Voice Communication: Users in a channel communicate with each other using voice only.
* Video Communication: Users in a channel communicate with each other with voice and video. Depending on different aggregate resolutions, video communication is split into two video formats with different unit prices:
    ≤ 720p
   &gt; 720p

The service is free of charge if the monthly voice and video usage is less than 10,000 minutes. The 10,000 minutes are deducted in the order of voice then video (≤ 720p and > 720p).
